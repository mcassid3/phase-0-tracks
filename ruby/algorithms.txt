Release 1: Shoveling driveway
Look out the window
If it has not snowed more than 2 inches:
    sit on  couch
    grab a beer
    say "no shoveling needed - woohoo!"
Else
    say "oh man"   
    Put on boots
    Put on hat
    Put on gloves
    Put on coat
    Walk into the garage and find the the shovel in the garage
    Walk to the end of the driveway to the curb's edge
    Turn 90 degrees so that you face the opposite edge of the driveway (be parallel to curb)
    Put shovel down on to the driveway
    Walk to the opposite edge with shovel on ground pushing snow
    Empty shovel of snow into the grass
    Turn 180 degrees
    Move a shovel's width back towards the house
    Place shovel down
    Walk back to the original edge of the drive you started from. 
    Repeat this process until there is no longer a shovel's width between you and the house

    If the dog walks in your pathway while shoveling, 
        yell "Please move"
        Wait for 3 seconds
        check again if the dog has moved
    If the dog has not moved, repeat one more time. 
    Now, independent of whether the dog has decided to move, continue in your shoveling path
    Place shovel back in garage
    exclaim "all done!"
