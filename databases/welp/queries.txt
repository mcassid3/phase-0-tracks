SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Ouput: 
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Angela|Jolie|1|5|amazing atmosphere|1|3
4|Lotus Yoga|1|Bradford|Pitt|2|3|awful servicee|4|1
5|Plumbing by Janet|4|Steven|Wonder|3|3|really liked the decor|5|4
6|Sushi World|6|Meryl|Streepman|4|4|convenient|6|6


2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first_name,users.last_name, businesses.name,reviews.stars,reviews.comment FROM businesses,users,reviews WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Output: 
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|amazing atmosphere
Bradford|Pitt|Lotus Yoga|3|awful servicee
Steven|Wonder|Plumbing by Janet|3|really liked the decor
Meryl|Streepman|Sushi World|4|convenient

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?Ê

SELECT * FROM businesses,users,reviews WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND businesses.id=1;

Output: 
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Angela|Jolie|1|5|amazing atmosphere|1|3
